Welcome to my mathematics journal! This is where I'll be documenting my mathematical explorations, proofs, and insights.

## What to Expect

In this journal, you'll find:

- **Proofs and Theorems**: Detailed proofs of mathematical results
- **Problem Solving**: Solutions to interesting problems
- **Explorations**: Deep dives into mathematical concepts
- **Notes**: Study notes and summaries

## Example: The Pythagorean Theorem

Here's a simple example of inline math: The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$, we have:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

### Proof Sketch

Consider a square with side length $a + b$. Inside this square, we can arrange four right triangles with legs $a$ and $b$, leaving a square of area $c^2$ in the center. The total area is:

$$(a + b)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{ab}{2} + c^2 = 2ab + c^2$$

Expanding the left side:

$$a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2$$

Subtracting $2ab$ from both sides gives us the desired result:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
