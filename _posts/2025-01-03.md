Welcome to this corner of the internet where I will have spent a signifigant time working through mathematics at a once in a lifetime depth (until the next time where greater depth is required). This year I have decided that I must restart serious study for my sanity, social life, and least of all, career prospects. 

To this end, I have selected Real and Complex Analysis as my first text to deeply digest. I have chosed this because I love the story of geometry but note that it feels all too difficult to pin down without the strongest analysis skills. Thus, if I can master this text, I will hopefully have the tools necessary at the forefront of my mind moving forward.
