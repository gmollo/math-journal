Welcome to this corner of the internet where I will have spent a signifigant time working through mathematics at a once in a lifetime depth (until the next time where greater depth is required). This year I have decided that I must restart serious study for my sanity, social life, and least of all, career prospects. 

To this end, I have selected Real and Complex Analysis as my first text to deeply digest. I have chosed this because I love the story of geometry but note that it feels all too difficult to pin down without the strongest analysis skills. Thus, if I can master this text, I will hopefully have the tools necessary at the forefront of my mind moving forward. 

Saturated sets: My instinct is just to imagine that the definition of a saturated set is one that can be represented by the preimage of some set with respect to a quotient map. A quotient map is a "strongly continuous" map which maps open sets to open sets and closed sets to closed sets. Supposing pi is a quotient map, then if C is a saturated set of an open set, then it is open, if it is the preimage of a closed set it is closed. furthermore you can project C via p and its topolologcal openness or closedness is preserved. The definition of a saturated set is that it contains every set it intersects. In this i am assuming a noninjectgive map p because this woulkd be trivial otherwise. In this case, it needs to contain all points of the preimage. I suppose these points should share a name. Additionally, if p is not injective on C then there are subsets of C such that p(C) = p(A) and A is a subset of C. but that pi inverse of pi of A does not equal A. This is lining up to say that the reason for saturated sets is that they are invertible with respect to pi.
