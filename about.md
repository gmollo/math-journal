# About

Hi I'm Joseph. I graduated with a Bachelors in Mathematics in 2024 from Washington University in St Louis. I'm currently engaged as a Data Engineer. I am hopeful that in the future I will transition to a PhD program in Mathematics.

This is a mathematics journal where I explore various mathematical topics, work through proofs, and document my learning journey.

Feel free to browse through the posts and explore different mathematical concepts!
